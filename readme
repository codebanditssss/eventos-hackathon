# EventOS â€“ AI Powered Event Coordination Platform

## Overview

EventOS is a unified event management and coordination platform designed to replace the fragmented workflows of traditional event planning. Organizers currently rely on multiple disconnected tools for scheduling, vendor coordination, communication, and reporting. This leads to data silos, miscommunication, and poor attendee and sponsor experiences.

EventOS provides a single source of truth for organizers, vendors, volunteers, attendees, and sponsors. With AI-driven automation, role-based dashboards, and real-time updates, EventOS simplifies event planning, execution, and analysis.

## Problem Statement

Event organizers use over 10 separate tools to manage a single event, causing:

* data silos and duplicated work
* delayed communication and missed updates
* vendor coordination issues
* poor sponsor ROI tracking
* weak attendee experience

45% of event failures are attributed to planning and coordination breakdowns rather than external factors.
