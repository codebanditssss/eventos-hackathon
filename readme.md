## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Event coordination chaos costs the industry $2.3 billion annually.**

Event organizers currently use **10+ separate tools** to manage a single event, causing:

- **Data Silos**: Information scattered across platforms
- **Communication Delays**: Critical updates get lost
- **Vendor Coordination Issues**: No centralized tracking
- **Poor Sponsor ROI**: Lack of unified metrics
- **Weak Attendee Experience**: Fragmented information

**EventOS consolidates everything into one intelligent platform.**
